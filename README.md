# 260123_CityView

260123_CityView is a curated collection of city blockout meshes organized by district, intended for layout, lighting, and scene prototyping workflows in DCC tools or game engines.

## Features
- District-based organization for quick scene assembly
- Separate mesh categories (building, land, overpass, plot, sidewalk, street)
- OBJ format assets for broad tool compatibility

## Getting Started
1) Clone the repository.
2) Open any `.obj` file from a district folder in your preferred DCC tool or engine.
3) Assemble or replace meshes as needed for your scene.

## Controls
Controls depend on the tool you use to view the meshes; use your application's standard viewport navigation.
